# :earth_africa: Space Escape
*A WebGL and Three.js graphics game in collaboration with the lovely* [@milenamayumi](https://github.com/milenamayumi)

**Objective**: Navigate the grid and get to the (space?) car to make your escape! Avoid lazers and molten lava guards. Pick up the blue orb for limited opporunity to pass through obstacles.

Controls:
* W = Forward
* S = Backward
* A = Right 
* D = Left

A and D are switched for added confusion :stuck_out_tongue:
